# Predict-Home-Prices
### Predict Home Prices with Python and Linear Regression



# Introduction
Have you ever wanted to know how much an apartment or house costs to rent or own in your area? How do machine learning and statistics work with a powerful programming language like Python?

Machine learning is a major field that lets computers take in data and learn patterns to make predictions and decisions. We will be using Python to learn about one of the fundamentals of predictive modeling in machine learning and, more specifically, linear regression. To help us out, we will use a few data science libraries:

Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
